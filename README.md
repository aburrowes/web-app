# web-app
This git hub page has all of the code needed to run the current web application for the Wherehouse project. 
The code contains php, html, and javascript files for the web application to work. The index.html, scan.js, and instascan.min.js are used to 
scan QR code data and send that data to a php table to be retrieved by an esp 8266. The esp 8266 will then update another table with the important data 
such as stock of an item and weight of an item.
